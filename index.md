Pynbody is a light-weight,
portable, format-transparent analysis framework for N-body and
hydrodynamic astrophysical simulations supporting PKDGRAV/Gasoline,
Gadget, N-Chilada, and RAMSES AMR outputs.

Written for python 2.7 or 3.4+, the core tools are accompanied by a library of
publication-level analysis routines. 

To install, type

```python
pip install pynbody
```
